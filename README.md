# The Odin Project - JavaScript
## Project: 🌦️ Weather App

This is a simple weather app built as part of my practice with asynchronous JavaScript, fetching APIs, and DOM manipulation. The app allows users to input a location and retrieves real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API.

**🧠 APIs Used**
* Geolocation API to gather the user's approximate location
* Visual Crossing API to fetch the weather data
  
**🛠️ Features**
* Input form to search weather by city name
* Fetches live weather data using fetch with async/await
* Processes and displays relevant weather info like:
* Temperature
* Weather description
* Location name
* Error handling for invalid city names
* Basic responsive layout
* loading spinner while fetching data
* Weather icons

**📦 What I Practiced**
* Working with Promises, async/await, and the Fetch API
* Parsing and restructuring JSON data
* Dynamically updating the DOM
* Adding loading indicators to improve UX experience

**🚀 How to Run**
1. Clone this repo
2. ```npm install``` to install the dependencies
3. ```npm run start``` to start the dev server
4. Enter the city in the field and press enter or click the button to fetch the data!
